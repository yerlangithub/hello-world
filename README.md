some trial work
Hello!

Here I try to get familiar with GitHub for the first time.

Before I have heard about GitHub and even visited link provided by some people to their pages with charing codes and so on but never gone further than looking the first page. At the first look GitHub looks complicated and does not look like anything else I have seen before.

So I am here to try. Let's start!
